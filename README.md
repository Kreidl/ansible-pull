# ansible-pull

This repo contains a example ansible pull playbook<br/>

For this a shell script should be written for the nodes (see provision.sh)<br/>

You should have postfix installed to get mails for the cronjobs execution<br/>
sudo apt-get install -y postfix<br/>
Additonally errors will be see under /var/mail/root
